## Window Blind Wand Coupler and Extension

The coupler works with [Home Depot vertical blinds](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Window-Treatments-Blinds-Vertical-Blinds/N-5yc1vZbc7c) wands such as [this one](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Hampton-Bay-3-5-in-W-x-102-in-L-Crown-White-3-5-in-Vertical-Blind-Louver-Set-9-pack-10793478818266/303806575). 
This was originally designed to extend the wand of a hard to reach setup. A 
[1/4" wooden dowel](https://www.michaels.com/36in-dowel-by-woodgrain-millwork/M10529354.html) was painted with acrylic paint and attached to the other end of the coupler with a [#6 x3.8in screw](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Everbilt-6-x-3-8-in-Phillips-Pan-Head-Zinc-Plated-Sheet-Metal-Screw-16-Pack-806191/204275189). The wand side is meant to be press fit and 
should attach and detach with a bit of force.
